# Tic Tac Toe (XO) Game 🎮

A simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++.

This project was originally done during my first year in college, and I recently rebuilt it during Eid to test my progress in coding and design. Proud to say I completed it in just 2 hours with cleaner, more efficient code.

## 🚀 Features

- Player vs Player mode
- Clean and modular OOP design
- Terminal-based interface
- Simple user input and validation
- Game result detection (Win / Draw)

## 🛠️ Built With

- C++
- Object-Oriented Programming

## 📦 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahmedyasser1588/Tic_Tac_Toe.git
Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (like g++).
